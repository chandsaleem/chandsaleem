## Hi there 👋 I am Chand Saleem!


Backend Engineer turned Data Analyst.

After building scalable systems with Java, J2EE, JAX-RS, JavaFX, SQL, and AWS microservices, 
I realized what I enjoy most is not just building systems — but understanding the data behind them.

Having worked closely with clients and Business Analysts, I learned how to translate business problems into technical solutions.  
Now I do the same — but through data.

I work with:
• Excel for structured analysis  
• SQL for data extraction and transformation  
• Python for deeper analytics  
• Power BI for clean, decision-driven dashboards  

I believe good analysis tells a story. Great analysis drives action.
